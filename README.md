## The Short Description
Chirp is an application where a user can read other user's messages called *Cheeps*, or send their own Cheeps for everyone else to read. Only a logged in user can send Cheeps. It is possible to register an account either through GitHub or by Chirp's own user registration. A logged in user also has the option to follow other users (and unfollow them, if you no longer want to see their stuff).
