## The Short Description
Chirp is an application where a user can read other users messages called *Cheeps*, or send their own cheeps for everyone else to read. Only a logged in user can send cheeps. It is possible to register an account either through GitHub or by Chirp's own method. A logged in user also has the option to follow other users (and unfollow if you no longer want to see their stuff).
